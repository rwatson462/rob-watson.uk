	<h1>🧑‍🚀 Hello, Astronaut!</h1>
	<p>
		I have no idea why the Astro default blog template starts with "astronaut" but I quite like it,
		so I'm keeping it. 🚀
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the portfolio page of one Rob Watson, a software developer and head of engineering, passionate
		about building quality and performance into everything I do.
